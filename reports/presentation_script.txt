Slide 1 – Title: “S&P 500 Stock Regression Project”
What to say:
- “Hi everyone, my name is Paul Lopes, and this is my Regression Methods project.”
- “I analyzed S&P 500 stock data using multiple linear regression to see which simple stock characteristics can explain differences in 1‑year returns.”
- “All of the analysis was done in R, and the full code and data pipeline are in my GitHub repo.”
Notes / meaning:
- S&P 500 = 500 large U.S. companies; familiar dataset.
- Regression = explain how a response (1-year return) depends on predictors.
- Mention reproducibility (R + GitHub).

Slide 2 – Abstract (What did I do?)
What to say:
- “Goal: explain cross-sectional variation in 1-year S&P 500 returns using technical indicators.”
- “Dataset: Cam Nugent’s Kaggle daily prices (2013–2018) covering 500+ tickers.”
- “Approach: feature engineering + multiple linear regression in R with diagnostics.”
- “Key result: Model explains 53% of variance; momentum and volatility dominate.”
Notes / meaning:
- Cross-sectional = compare many stocks at once.
- Predictors = inputs; response = 1-year log return.
- R² ≈ 0.53 means half of return differences captured.

Slide 3 – Introduction (What is the problem?)
What to say:
- “Prompt asked for a regression analysis with a scientific-paper structure.”
- “Research question: Which price-based characteristics predict annual returns?”
- “Motivation: provide simple screening rules using only public price data.”
Notes / meaning:
- Tie back to project requirements.
- Momentum = recent up/down trends; volatility = riskiness.

Slide 4 – Materials & Methods (1/2)
What to say:
- “Data: 619k daily rows (OHLCV) from Cam Nugent’s Kaggle dataset.”
- “Variables include open/high/low/close, volume, ticker, and date.”
- “Tools: R with tidyverse, lubridate, broom; scripted in sp500_regression.R.”
Notes / meaning:
- OHLCV stands for Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
- tidyverse = data manipulation suite; lubridate handles dates; broom formats models.

Slide 5 – Materials & Methods (2/2)
What to say:
- “Response: log(price_2018-01-02 / price_2017-01-03).”
- “Predictors use only 2017 data, so the setup is forward-looking.”
- “Log returns treat gains and losses symmetrically and simplify math.”
Notes / meaning:
- Avoid look-ahead bias by not using future info.
- Log return example: log(1.2) ≈ 0.182.

Slide 6 – Feature Engineering (Predictors)
What to say:
- “Volatility: annualized standard deviation of 2017 daily log returns.”
- “Average volume: mean daily volume (millions of shares).”
- “Momentum 90: log return over first 90 trading days of 2017.”
- “Trend MA30: relative difference between initial price and 30-day moving average.”
Notes / meaning:
- Annualizing volatility multiplies daily SD by sqrt(252).
- Moving average smooths short-term noise.

Slide 7 – Feature Engineering Workflow
What to say:
- “Pipeline: raw CSV → clean daily data → compute predictors per ticker → final dataset (503 rows).”
- “Each row now represents one company with engineered features.”
Notes / meaning:
- Feature engineering = turning raw data into model-ready summaries.

Slide 8 – Results: Descriptive Statistics
What to say:
- “Mean 1-year log return ≈ 0.187 (~20% simple return).”
- “Median volatility ≈ 0.25; volume is tens of millions of shares.”
- “Momentum interquartile range spans roughly -4% to +12%.”
Notes / meaning:
- IQR = 75th percentile minus 25th percentile; measures spread.

Slide 9 – Results: Model Fit
What to say:
- “R² = 0.529, adjusted R² = 0.525.”
- “Residual standard error = 0.158 log-return units.”
- “F-statistic ≈ 140 with tiny p-value → model as a whole is significant.”
Notes / meaning:
- R² = proportion of variance explained.
- Residual SE = typical prediction error.

Slide 10 – Results: Coefficients
What to say:
- “Momentum coefficient ≈ 1.05 (p<1e-38): stronger early momentum → higher annual returns.”
- “Volatility coefficient ≈ -0.47 (p≈2e-7): high volatility stocks underperformed.”
- “Volume and MA trend not significant once other predictors included.”
Notes / meaning:
- Interpretation: holding others constant, a 0.1 increase in momentum raises expected log return by about 0.105.
- p-values >0.05 mean effect not clearly different from zero.

Slide 11 – Diagnostic: Residuals vs Fitted
What to say:
- “Residuals scatter symmetrically around zero without obvious funnel shape.”
- “Supports linearity and constant-variance assumptions.”
Notes / meaning:
- Residual = actual minus predicted.
- Looking for random cloud; patterns indicate model issues.

Slide 12 – Diagnostic: Normal Q-Q Plot
What to say:
- “Residual quantiles line up with the theoretical normal line except slight tail deviations.”
- “Normality assumption is acceptable for inference.”
Notes / meaning:
- Q-Q plot tests whether residuals follow normal distribution.

Slide 13 – Discussion (What does it mean?)
What to say:
- “Momentum dominates, consistent with Jegadeesh & Titman’s findings.”
- “Negative volatility coefficient suggests investors preferred stability in 2017.”
- “Volume and MA trend add minimal signal beyond momentum.”
Notes / meaning:
- Connect to finance literature and intuition.

Slide 14 – Limitations & Future Work
What to say:
- “Single-year horizon; need multi-year validation.”
- “No sector fixed effects or macro variables.”
- “Only linear model—future work could use LASSO or tree ensembles.”
- “Add fundamentals like valuation metrics for richer models.”
Notes / meaning:
- Fixed effects = dummy variables for sectors.
- LASSO = penalized regression for feature selection.
